# Password Generator
Simple password generator , The password is generated in your browser; this tool does not transfer your password anywhere.

# Why is the javascript embedded within the html?
So you can just download the file and run it locally if you'd feel more comfortable using it that way.

# Is is cryptographically secure?
No. It's uses javascript's Math.random(), That doesn't mean it's useless though, it's still better than using 'password123' for each of your passwords.
